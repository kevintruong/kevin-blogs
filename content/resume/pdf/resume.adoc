This is C Framework.
I made it so long time ago to practice about design pattern and learn about operation system.
By using the project, we can quickly and simply create C application.
The dea based on Event Driven and Infinite State Machine.
Love to finish/stable the project but don't have time now.

Features:

* Simple and quick create C application
* Support log
* Support state machine and event driven
* Support HAL to simple port the application to another platform

==== https://github.com/kevintruong/workspace-rsync[Workspace Rsync]

* Support multi blog source by configure file

==== Some articles in Medium and my blogs

I think to become a good software engineer, beside good at coding, design,knowledge... The other good thing should I have is better on writing.
The writing skill will help me a lot on detail my design, thought, explaining about idea ... slow down the code flow for better quality.
That's why I have a blog https://kencancode.xyz[here] and trying to public few of it on `Medium`

Below is few of those.
Please take a look on my https://kencancode.xyz[blog] fore more ...
