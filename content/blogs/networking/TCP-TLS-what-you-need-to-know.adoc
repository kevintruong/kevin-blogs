I work for a software company, mostly working on developing router.
But honestly, I feel lacks of knowledge on some kind of fundamentals of networking like TCP, UDP, DHCP, ...
I saw some kind of simple question on how to send/received package with TCP socket and when I come to deep dive on this portion.
No one can tell me detail about it.
That why I decided to relearn and write something about it.

== Define

* TCP and UDP, the two guys are really famous with all IT Engineer.
They are transport protocol and they are on layer 3 in OSI model.
TCP is some kind of guarantee transport protocol and otherwise for UDP,non-guarantee transport protocol.
and then guarantee and non-guarantee also is different between TCP and UDP.
TCP guarantee that we can send and receive data in network link in order and stable.
Each package received by receiver will send ack signal to confirm with sender.
TCP send and receiver have responsibility on data send and received.
Each time data received by receiver, Receiver have responsibility to send ack to sender or if it did not received correct data or the order to data packet is not correct.
It will send NACK for the package.
Sender when received NACK signal will try to resend the not correct/lost package.

* In another hand, UDP just send out the data , they don't care about how much receiver capability on receiving data from senders.
in the mind of UDP is that I have a lot of data.
I just send it to receiver.
I did not give a shit on how Receiver process the data.
Maybe receiver will lost some data, the data is crash by channel noise.
UDP sender say: It's not my responsibility, I have data , I already send it to you (receiver). and that's it.

== Features

In the blog, I will go to detail about the TCP protocol.

1. *Connection management*: How connection established and how to terminate the connection
2. *Reliablitity*: Using sequence numbers (used for segements reodering) and retransmission.
3. *Flow control*: Make sure sender do not overflow a receiver.
4. *Congestion control*: Make sure sender do not overflow network.

the features 3 and 4 are the same purpose (limit the overflow) but different layer.

The 3 (Flow Control) will limit the sender from overflow receiver (Application layer).
Receiver will tell to Sender about what size of data it (receiver) can receive.

The 4 (Congestion Control) will limit the server from overflow the network (Link Layer).

=== Connection management

==== Establish connection

For establishing a connection, TCP will perform handshake protocol called 3 way handshake

[.text-center]
.*TCP Handshake*
[plantuml,tcp-handshake,svg,align=center]
----
Sender --> Receiver : SYN,seq_s=rnd()
Sender <-- Receiver : SYN,seq_r=rnd(),ACK=seq_s+1 (1 byte)

Sender --> Sender: isAckCorrect(),
Sender --> Receiver : ACK,seq_s=seq_r+1

Receiver --> Receiver: isAckCorrect()
Sender <--> Receiver: Connection established
----

* Sender will send SYN package is ramdom number x=rnd() to receiver.

* Receiver will reply to sender by send ACK which ACK = x + 1 and SYN is also ramdom number y = rnd().

* Sender will check the ACK is correct by comparing the value of SYN send with ACK received:

[source]
----
x_s + 1 == x_r
----

* if the ACK is correct, then sender will send ACK package which y_s = y_r + 1
* Receiver received the ACK. At the time, the connection between sender and receiver is established

Above is describe about how to establish a TCP connection.
We need matching the process to simple TCP clients/server code.
In this case, TCP client is sender and TCP server is receiver.

.*TCP 3-ways Handshake*
image::tcp_handshake.png[align=center]

So, for establishing a TCP connection, sender and receiver mut perfom 3 ways handshake.
sender must sync with receiver a sender magic number, and also receive will also sync with sender a receiver magic number After synchronize both magic numbers, the tcp connection will be established

==== Terminate connection
//TODO add write about how to terminate

=== Reliablitity

Before go dive to TCP transfer data sequence, I think we need to know about some terminology

* Initial Squence Number (ISN) :
** Each sides has its own ISN. Can use ramdom number
** ISN is byte level number. each time a sender send a number of bytes data. then sender will has new ISN number = old ISN + send bytes number.

*For example*: initial ISN = 1000. After send 100 bytes, then the next ISN is 1000+ 100 bytes= 1100

* In the 3 ways handshake above, if Sender select ISN is 1000, and receiver select ISN is 5000 then after handshake process, each ISN will increase by 1. And then when TCP connection is established.
ISN number of sender is 1001 and ISN number of receiver is 5001. Because of each time sender/receiver send a SYN packet means that each of them send 1 byte of data.
Then ISN number as byte level will increase by 1.

We will use the example above to describe how TCP transfer data

For now, we know how established TCP connection and also how it transfer data from sender to receiver and otherwise.
To transfer data in TCP. First of all need to establish a connection.
The work need to take 2 `Round Trip`.

I said `round trip` right, this is new definition but hard to explain it to easy to understand.
Then we can understand the definition by example:

I said established TCP connection take about 2 round trips.
So why 2 round trips.

* The first one round trip is the route of SYN packet send from sender to receiver plus to the route of ACK packet send from receiver to sender.

* The second round trip is the route of sync packet send from receiver to sender and also the route of ACK packet send from receiver to sender.

So the Route Trip mean the full route of packet to a destination plus to full route of packet response.
And the time to complete a route trip is Route Trip Time (RTT)

=== Flow Control

Receiver has received buffer (FIFO) to store data from the Sender.
The size of TCP Received Buffer defined by multiple OS with different value.
When TCP established, sender and receiver will exchange the free received buffer by read out `window size` value of TCP header.
Then sender and receiver will know how much data it can send to each other.

[.text-center]
.TCP Header format
image::TCP_header.png[align=center]

Now we have number call `window size`.
In another words, it is the remain free of received buffer.
Whenever the buffer received an amount of data from sender.
TCP stack will update the remain free at current time and TCP stack will update the value to ACK package response back.
Then sender can not send TCP data packet with size larger than `window size` which read from previous ACK packet.

end
----

=== Congestion Control

As I mentioned above, TCP using receive window (ACK package) to inform the sender about receiver's capability.
But there will have another problem to solve.
That is about network capability.
Receiver just said to Sender that how much it can receive.
So what if receiver say "I can receive about 5GB".
Then sender will push all 5GB at the same time.

It will overflow the network (the path from sender to receiver).
TCP solves the case by implement congestion control mechanism.
Not like Flow Control while Sliding Window (rwnd) is stored in TCP header send from Receiver.
In Congestion Control will use another number call congestion window (cwnd).
The number is only cared by Sender to define how much data can be send into network without acknowledged.
In another words, that mean the sender can send limited number of TCP packets without wait one by one ACK.

The purpose of this is control how much the sender will push data out network to avoid overflow network.
