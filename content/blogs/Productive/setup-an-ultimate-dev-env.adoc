Trying to remember what command I need on specific work, navigate to multiple terminal for monitoring process or debug log, speed up on prepare dev environment for specific project ...etc.
This document describe about how I configure my development Environment to boost up my productivity.
The setup will based on some awesome tools like `tmux`, `oh-my-zsh` , `oh-my-tmux`, `fzf`,`jump`,`tmuxinator`

== ZSH - OH MY ZSH

I just changed from bash to zsh recently by accident.
Yes, it is not an intended changing from bash to zsh.
The reason for this because I change OS from ubuntu to debian and then with unknow reason my sweet tool `fzf`
do not work well.
Yes, already tried to debug for fixing this.
But can not, then I try to work around it by switching to `fzf`.
because fzf is my love.
When I came `zsh` , I found out that there has a framework for zsh called `oh-my-zsh` to make more productivity by simple adding/removing plugins.
Yes there have alot of useful plugins for `oh-my-zsh`.
And you can also feel easy to add/remove plugins with `oh-my-zsh`

=== Install oh-my-zsh

For install `oh-my-zsh`, firstly you need to install zsh

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt install -y zsh
----

install `oh-my-zsh` by simple command

[source,shell]
----
# via curl
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
----

basically, after run the command above, you done with install `oh-my-zsh`.
But yes, we need to make some customize for better productivity then we need some plugins

=== oh-my-zsh useful plugins

`oh-my-sh` already has built-in plugins.
But need to enable it.
To enable `oh-my-zsh` plugins.
editting file ~/.zshrc

[source,shell]
----
vi ~/.zshrc
----

Adding plugins which you want to enable in field `plugins=(...)`
my lovely useful is bellow

[source,shell]
----
# Which plugins would you like to load?
# Standard plugins can be found in ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/*
# Custom plugins may be added to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.
plugins=(git
        zsh-completions
        zsh-autosuggestions
        vi-mode
        rsync
        ripgrep
        cp
        common-aliases
        alias-finder
        tmuxinator
        web-search
        debian
        extract
)
