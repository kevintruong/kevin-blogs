.Purpose
****
How do I speed up my work flow, how I can feel easy while working and not restrict by some kind of boring work like:
Trying to remember what command I need on specific work, navigate to multiple terminal for monitoring process or debug log, speed up on prepare dev environment for specific project ...etc.
This document describe about how I configure my development Environment to boost up my productivity.
The setup will based on some awesome tools like `tmux`, `oh-my-zsh` , `oh-my-tmux`, `fzf`,`jump`
****

== ZSH - OH MY ZSH

I just changed from bash to zsh recently by accident.
Yes, it is not an intended changing from bash to zsh.
The reason for this because I change OS from ubuntu to debian and then with unknow reason my sweet tool `fzf`
do not work well.
Yes, already tried to debug for fixing this.
But can not, then I try to work around it by switching to `fzf`.
because fzf is my love.
When I came `zsh` , I found out that there has a framework for zsh called `oh-my-zsh` to make more productivity by simple adding/removing plugins.
Yes there have alot of useful plugins for `oh-my-zsh`.
And you can also feel easy to add/remove plugins with `oh-my-zsh`

=== Install oh-my-zsh

For install `oh-my-zsh`, firstly you need to install zsh

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt install -y zsh
----

install `oh-my-zsh` by simple command

[source,shell]
----
# via curl
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
----

basically, after run the command above, you done with install `oh-my-zsh`.
But yes, we need to make some customize for better productivity then we need some plugins

=== oh-my-zsh useful plugins

`oh-my-sh` already has built-in plugins.
But need to enable it.
To enable `oh-my-zsh` plugins.
editting file ~/.zshrc

[source,shell]
----
vi ~/.zshrc
----

Adding plugins which you want to enable in field `plugins=(...)`
my lovely useful is bellow.

[source,shell]
----
# Which plugins would you like to load?
# Standard plugins can be found in ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/*
# Custom plugins may be added to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.
plugins=(git
        zsh-completions
        zsh-autosuggestions
        vi-mode
        rsync
        ripgrep
        common-aliases
        alias-finder
        tmuxinator
        debian
        extract
)

== TMUX - TMUX PLUGIN

for console management, I use tmux + `oh-my-tmux` + some awesome tmux plugins.
Really appreciate `gpaksz` https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux . He make amazing work on create tmux configure file.
It is simple to isntall and have all things I need.
The tmux configured file come from him is really well structured and simple to adding more plugins.
And I love this vi-naviation style to switch between console.
for example:

[source,text]
----
bind-key -r -T prefix       h                     select-pane -L
bind-key -r -T prefix       j                     select-pane -D
bind-key -r -T prefix       k                     select-pane -U
bind-key -r -T prefix       l                     select-pane -R
----

or using the same VI Navigate key to edit current layout

[source,text]
----
bind-key -r -T prefix       J                     resize-pane -D 2
bind-key -r -T prefix       K                     resize-pane -U 2
bind-key -r -T prefix       L                     resize-pane -R 2
bind-key    -T prefix       M                     select-pane -M

=== Install oh-my-tmux

[.text-center]
.oh-my-tmux
image::tmux-real-demo.gif[align=center]

[align=center]
by command below, you can install `oh-my-tmux`

[source,shell]
----
cd
git clone https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux.git
ln -s -f .tmux/.tmux.conf
cp .tmux/.tmux.conf.local .
----

=== Awesome tmux plugins

For more comfortable, I will need some tmux plugins like bellow

[source,text]
----
# oh-my-tmux plugins (built-in)
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible'
# My plugins
set -g @plugin 'kristijanhusak/tmux-simple-git-status'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum'
set -g @plugin 'laktak/extrakto'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-copycat'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-yank'
----

* tmux-plugins/tpm : Tmux Plugin Manager.
You need this one to install other plugins.
It already buit-in when you install
`oh-my-tmux`
* kristijanhusak/tmux-simple-git-status: Dispay git status in power bar
* link:https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect[tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect]: useful for save current workspace and restore it when you up again
** `<tmux-prefix-key> + <ctrl-s>` : Save current workspace
** `<tmux-prefix-key> + <ctrl-r>` : restore previous workspace
* link:https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum[tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum]: continuous saving of tmux environment, automatic tmux start when computer/server is turned on automatic restore when tmux is started
* link:https://github.com/laktak/extrakto[laktak/extrakto]: Output completions - you can complete commands that require you to retype text that is already on the screen.
This works everywhere, even in remote ssh sessions.
* link:https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-copycat[tmux-plugins/tmux-copycat]: his plugin enables: regex searches search result, highlighting, predefined searches
** `prefix + /` - regex search (strings work too)

Example search entries:

```
    foo - searches for string foo
    [0-9]+ - regex search for numbers
```

Grep is used for searching.
Searches are case insensitive.

** Predefined searches

```
    prefix + ctrl-f - simple file search
    prefix + ctrl-g - jumping over git status files (best used after git status command)
    prefix + alt-h - jumping over SHA-1/SHA-256 hashes (best used after git log command)
    prefix + ctrl-u - url search (http, ftp and git urls)
    prefix + ctrl-d - number search (mnemonic d, as digit)
    prefix + alt-i - ip address search
```

These start "copycat mode" and jump to first match.

* link:https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank[tmux-plugins/tmux-yank]:Tmux plugin for copying to system clipboard.
Works on OSX, Linux and Cygwin
** Normal Mode
*** `prefix–y` — copies text from the command line to the clipboard.
*** `prefix–Y` — copy the current pane's current working directory to the clipboard.

** Copy Mode
*** `y` — copy selection to system clipboard.
*** `Y` (shift-y) — "put" selection.
Equivalent to copying a selection, and pasting it to the command line.

== FZF - JUMP

=== link:https://github.com/junegunn/fzf[FZF]

image::fzf-real-demo.gif[align=center]

fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.

[source,shell]
----
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf
~/.fzf/install
----

FZF is great tool to fuzzy find what command you already run After installed, it will replace the reverse-search `Ctrl-r` by fzf search like demo above.

=== link:https://github.com/gsamokovarov/jump[JUMP]

There has problem that I need to install the utility tool also.
Tmux will help use solve the naviation between multiple console.
but we will need a easy way to navigate between multiple directories.
for example: we have some really long directory path like

```
/home/kevin/Project/kevin-blogs/content/projects/workspace-rsync/Docs
```

to navigate to the directory above from `$HOME`. then we need go through alot the `Docs` parent of parent directories... etc

So, `jump` will help us on the issue by remember name of what directory we are already in before

`Jump` will support many ways to install like bellow

[source,shell]
----
#macOS
brew install jump

#Ubuntu
wget https://github.com/gsamokovarov/jump/releases/download/v0.30.1/jump_0.30.1_amd64.deb && sudo dpkg -i jump_0.30.1_amd64.deb

#Fedora
wget https://github.com/gsamokovarov/jump/releases/download/v0.30.1/jump-0.30.1-1.x86_64.rpm && sudo rpm -i jump-0.30.1-1.x86_64.rpm

#Nix
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.jump

# Go
go get github.com/gsamokovarov/jump


----

*Integration*

Jump needs to be integrated with the shell.
For bash and zsh, the line below needs to be in ~/.bashrc, ~/bash_profile or ~/.zshrc:

```shell
eval "$(jump shell)"
```

== Enable vi-mode in tmux and oh-my-zsh

To enable vi style in oh-my-zsh, you need to push `vi-mode` to plugins list like bellow
```shell
plugins=(...
        vi-mode
        ...)
```

to enable vi style in tmux, you also need to set vi-mode option in ~/.tmux.conf

```shell
set -g @shell_mode 'vi'
set-window-option -g mode-keys vi
```
