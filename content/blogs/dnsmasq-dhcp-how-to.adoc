== How dnsmasq-dhcp allocate Ip address for dhcp client

=== DHCP sequences

image::blogs/dhcp-4-exhcange.png[]

at begining, there 4 step to complete DHCP request.

- DHCP Discovery (client send)
- DHCP Offer (server send)
- DHCP Request (client send)
- DHCP Ack (server send)

there have a exception case with window. that window dhcp client will issue
inform dhcp message (broadcast) in port 67 that the window client will use a
address , if the address is valid , server will send a unicast dhcp ack in new connection
to the client (port 68)

for renewing, client simple send unicast dhcp request to server, server simple send unicast dhcp ack
responds if there ip address is avai. Otherwise, the message response should be NACK

for Release, client just simple send dhcp lease message to server.

Above is simple explain about dhcp request/allocate sequence.

=== How dnsmasq handle dhcp request/allocate
dnsmasq will handle dhcp request follow the dhcp sequences already explain above.
detail about how it implement could be so long, then I only explain what I see
while make patch for it.

dnsmasq follow rfc2131 to implement dhcp protocol.
client send dhcp-discovery => dnsmasq => send hdcp-offer.
first of all, dnsmasq will find in lease list (back up in a lease file ) obtain
all ip address already provide for client.

the lease list will load from lease file each time dnsmasq start/restart
by search physical address (MAC address) of client in lease list. dnsmasq will
reuse the ip-address with already provided to specific client.

with provided ip address clients, dnsmasq will reuse the provided ip address.
The provided ip address only allocate to another client in case dnsmasq has not other choise.
for example run out ip address to allocate which lead to must reuse ip address of client who already send dhcp lease message.

back to dnsmasq, with first time dhcp allocate to dhcp client, dnsmasq will handle discovery request
from it. First of all it will looking for whether or not the client has been allocated.
If it not, dhcp will run `address_allocate`, basically, the function will pick a available ip address based on option
`--dhcp_sequential_ip` or not. In another words, It will allocate available IP in sequential or using
hashing algorithm to get unique avai ip address in range.

if (option_bool(OPT_CONSEC_ADDR))
	    /* seed is largest extant lease addr in this context */
	    start = lease_find_max_addr(c);
	  else
	    /* pick a seed based on hwaddr */
	    start.s_addr = htonl(ntohl(c->start.s_addr) +
				 ((j + c->addr_epoch) % (1 + ntohl(c->end.s_addr) - ntohl(c->start.s_addr))));

	  /* iterate until we find a free address. */
	  addr = start;

Base on the current implement I think it should be a problems in how dnsmasq allocate available IP address
assuming that We have dhcp range from 192.168.0.10 (min) and 192.168.0.100 (max), then the pool size is 90 ip address

The dnsmasq using option `--dhcp-sequential-ip` then we have many dhcp client allocate by the dnsmasq from
`192.168.0.10` to `192.168.30`. In there time, using another dhcp client send dhcp request or dhcp discovery with option 50
(requested ip address) the requested ip address is `192.168.0.80`

Based on the current implement of dnsmasq with options `dhcp-sequential-ip` it should have issue there.
that the function `lease_find_max_addr` will return the lease object of `192.168.0.80`
mean we will only have 9 availabe ipaddress actual compare to `69` expected.

so there must have another implement for smarter handle the case.
it turn the find max lease address into math work search min and get max in round.

for example:

- The ipaddress already allocated can be: `20,1,2,3,4,30,31,32,50,60,70`
the simple way is sort the list in order, find max in round from min. the sorted lease list is
`1,2,3,4,20,30,31,32,50,60,70`. The min of lease is 1 and max in round is 4.
to archived it then need to modified the implement of allocate_address. need to sort after allocate
there have ipv4 and ipv6 which dnsmasq-dhcp will allocate.
Then need to devide and conquere:
